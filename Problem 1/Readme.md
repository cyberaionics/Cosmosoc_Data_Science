# In the 1st FITS file, 
The picture may signify a star or a quasar

# In the 2nd FITS file, 
The picture contains multiple, distinct peaks of high intensity which may signify a nearby galaxy, an open cluster or a globular cluster

# In the 3rd FITS file,
The picture might represent a planetary nebula or a supernova remnant but it is a dynamical, evolutionary snapshot

# In the 4th FITS file, 
The picture may be a snapshot of a galaxy or a dense star cluster

# In the 5th FITS file, 
The picture shows a central galaxy surrounded by numerous foreground and background stars.

# In the 6th FITS file, 
It is a picture of classic, large face-on spiral galaxy.

# In the 7th FITS file, 
The picture is a large, diffuse object, most likely a supernova remnant or a planetary nebula.

# In the 8th FITS file, 
The image shows clear image of an edge-on disk galaxy. You can see the bright central bulge and the flat disk, which is bisected by a dark dust lane.

# For the 9th and 10th FITS files, 
The interpretation is not very clear. These images might show much fainter or more distant objects, possibly small galaxies or individual stars, against a "noisy" background.
