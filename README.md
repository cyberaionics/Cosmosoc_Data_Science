# Team Gradient Descender exploring the depths of Cosmosoc
### The solution to Data Science Problem Statement of IIT Dharwad Space Data Science club induction hackathon by Team Gradient Descenders.

## Problem 1:
**The First Problem is about understanding the depths of the space by converting the portable images sent by the *Research Vessel*. For that purpose, access the Problem 1 folder to see the solution.**

## Problem 2:
**The Mission shuttle took a hit and data became corrupted. The next objective is to retrieve and clean the data into *Cleaned_Dataset.csv* file. For that we have analysed the pattern and came up with its corresponding code *Gradient Descenders Notebook Cleaning.ipynb* file.**

## Bonus Problem:
**To detect the people who were transported by the anomaly.**
